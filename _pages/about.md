_Apa kabar?_

I am first-year Finance PhD student at the Finance Department of Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. 
Prior to starting my PhD, I was employed as empirical research fellow at the same department.

My research interest, as of now, is at the intersection of finance, development, and inequality. 
If you are Indonesian undergraduate and would like to talk more about predoctoral research 
assistantship in economics or economics-adjacent areas, please reach out to me directly

You can find my CV <a href="/assets/images/about/CV.pdf">here</a>

Prior to academia, I have spent around 6 years of full-time equivalent in private sector, 
economic policy consulting, and policy research. I spend around the first quarter of a century living 
in Greater Jakarta before coming to Chicagoland (fun fact: Jakarta and Chicago proper are roughly
similar in terms of total landmass, but Jakarta has almost 4x the population size)

Trivia: up until high school, I had always wanted to be an architect and still retain a great deal
of interest in the field as a layman (which explains my intellectual appreciation of the ideas behind
brutalism). I don't have any band that I like in particular, but Spotify suggested that I most often 
listen to King Gizzard \& The Lizard Wizard, Arctic Monkeys, Barasuara, and Tchaikovsky.
I also have unhealthy obsession with coffee (Indonesian single-origin Arabica in particular) 
and bourbon
