_Apa kabar?_

I am empirical research fellow at the Finance Department of Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University

Prior to going to academia, I have spent around 5 years of full-time equivalent in private sector, 
economic policy consulting, and policy research. I spend around the first quarter of a century living 
in Greater Jakarta before coming to Chicagoland (fun fact: Jakarta and Chicago proper are roughly
similar in terms of total landmass, but Jakarta has almost 4x the population size)

My research interest, as of now, is in the intersection of finance, development, and inequality. 
Why, you might ask? Think of loan sharks or payday lenders, and people will instantly be repulsed by the very notion of
these marginal groups of financial actors. However, most people stop at that before asking something
like "why do poor people still borrow from these people/institutions?". Depending on where you are,
the answers may differ a lot but we still see nuanced picture of how certain financial policies that
are designed for other purposes (say, more stringent anti-money laundering policies or increase in
capital requirement to better protect against banking collapse) make lending to poorer borrowers 
more expensive for larger, more formal financial institutions. These seemingly counterintuitive
insights are, however, crucial if we are to create better financial policies and market design.

If you are Indonesian undergraduate and would like to talk more about predoctoral research 
assistantship in economics or economics-adjacent areas, please reach out to me directly
