I am a second year Finance PhD student at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. My research interests currently include but are not limited to macro-finance, household finance, and development economics. 

I grew up and lived in Jakarta before moving to Chicago. I have quite a few personal interests that may/may not be orthogonal to economics and finance, such as architecture (trivia: I initially wanted to be an architect!), photography, history, coffee (specifically pourover, single-origin coffee), whiskey, and craft beers. This page features both of my professional work and some curation of my personal interests
