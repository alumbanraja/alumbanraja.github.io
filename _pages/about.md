_Apa kabar?_
I am empirical research fellow at the Finance Department of Northwestern Kellogg

Prior to going to academia, I have spent around 5 years of full-time equivalent in private sector, 
economic policy consulting, and policy research. I spend around the first quarter of a century living 
in Greater Jakarta before coming to Chicagoland (fun fact: Jakarta and Chicago proper are roughly
similar in terms of total landmass, but Jakarta has almost 4x the population size)

My research interest, as of now, is in the intersection of finance, development, and inequality. 
Why, you might ask? A lot of times, I still see a lot of people thinking that the world of finance,
at least the one depicted in popular culture, is divorced and even antithetical to the problem of 
poverty and inequality in our modern market economy. This could not be further from the truth. 
Think of loan sharks or payday lenders, and people will instantly be repulsed by the very notion of
these marginal groups of financial actors. However, most people stop at that before asking something
like "why do poor people still borrow from these people/institutions?". Depending on where you are,
the answers may differ a lot but we still see nuanced picture of how certain financial policies that
are designed for other purposes (say, more stringent anti-money laundering policies or increase in
capital requirement to better protect against banking collapse) make lending to poorer borrowers 
more expensive for larger, more formal financial institutions. These seemingly counterintuitive
insights are, however, crucial if we are to create better financial policies and market design.

When not talking about financial economics, I like to talk about architecture and urban planning
(side note: I have strong bias for dense cities with good network of public transportation). 
I sometimes cook and bake (although most of them are comfort or indulgent foods #sorrynotsorry).

If you are Indonesian undergraduate and would like to talk more about predoctoral research 
assistantship, please reach out to me directly via email (see contact page)
